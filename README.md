# ktor-project-example
Tired of building and configuring dependencies from scratch each time. Therefore, I created this repository, simply by reusing it, albeit with extra dependencies, I will get what I need without spending extra 2-4 hours on configuration.

# What inside?
- Ktor
- Koin
- JUnit5
- TestContainers (in progress...)
- Kotlin Logging (SLF4j Api + Logback Core)
- Exposed
- Postgres JDBC
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
