# Template for creating a server application in Kotlin
Tired of building and configuring dependencies from scratch each time. Therefore, I created this repository, simply by reusing it, albeit with extra dependencies, I will get what I need without spending extra 2-4 hours on configuration.

# What inside?
- Ktor
- Koin (DI, for now without annotation)
- JUnit5
- TestContainers (in progress...)
- Kotlin Logging 
  - Frontend: SLF4j Api
  - Backend: Logback (default configs in progress..)
- Exposed (default configs & tests in progress...)
  - Postgres JDBC
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
